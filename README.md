# Pomodoro App

This is a front end project built as part of FreeCodeCamp's cirriculum. The website is for using a timer for working and taking breaks; the method is called the Pomodoro method. The settings are minimalistic in design. The user can pause, restart, and play the  pomodoro clock. I use jQueryProgress to display the progress of the pomodoro. 

## To Do

* Remember the setting the user makes for session, long break, and short break sessions.

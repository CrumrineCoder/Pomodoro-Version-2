# Pomodoro

To Do: 
*Convert Time
*CSS 
	Make three buttons for settings, longbreak, and short break, which change the CSS  of the three buttons but also change which timer the buttons affect and which timer is shown
Current Issues:
*The current pomodoro timer doesn't resume correctly because of how jQuery animations work. The issue is not very noticeable on times longer than 10 seconds, on the upside.

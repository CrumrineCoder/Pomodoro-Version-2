# Pomodoro App

This is a front end project built as part of FreeCodeCamp's cirriculum. The website is for using a timer for working and taking breaks; the method is called the Pomodoro method. The settings are minimalistic in design. The user can pause, restart, and play the  pomodoro clock. I use jQueryProgress to display the progress of the pomodoro. The app also uses jQueryProgress to display to the user the progress of the current Pomodoro the user is on.

I learned about intervals for this one and about minimalistic design: initially I had a large amount of buttons, but I was able to streamline them into a UI design I like. I want to learn about sessions and be able to store a user's preferences.

## User Stories

### FreeCodeCamp

* User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.
* User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.
* User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.

### Personal User Stories

* User Story: I can pause the clock.
* User Story: The timer is a circle and looks freakin' amazing. 
* User Story: Minimalistic Design.

## To Do

* Remember the setting the user makes for session, long break, and short break sessions.
